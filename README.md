# SimpleEdit
Windows Notepad replacement

-----

SimpleEdit is a text editor that replaces Windows' Notepad. It's significantly better:

- It can open files without messing up spaces, tabs, and newlines
- It has better editing capabilities (such as better tabs and indent preservation)
- It's had time spent on its development, instead of a last-minute throw-together Microsoft program
- It's far more customisable
- It's small, both in file size and in RAM usage
- It's fast
- It's easy to install (OK, Notepad comes pre-installed, but ssshhhhh...)

In short, if you hate Notepad (or have cause to use it frequently), you should be using this instead.

## Installation
Simple: go to the [install folder](https://github.com/ArtOfCode-/SimpleEdit/tree/master/install) and download the .zip file. Extract its contents, and run SimpleEdit.exe. Job done.

SimpleEdit doesn't rely on system-wide configuration, so can be run from any file location - even on USB.

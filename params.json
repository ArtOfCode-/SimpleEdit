{"name":"SimpleEdit","tagline":"Windows Notepad replacement text editor","body":"# SimpleEdit\r\nWindows Notepad replacement\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSimpleEdit is a text editor that replaces Windows' Notepad. It's significantly better:\r\n\r\n- It can open files without messing up spaces, tabs, and newlines\r\n- It has better editing capabilities (such as better tabs and indent preservation)\r\n- It's had time spent on its development, instead of a last-minute throw-together Microsoft program\r\n- It's far more customisable\r\n- It's small, both in file size and in RAM usage\r\n- It's fast\r\n- It's easy to install (OK, Notepad comes pre-installed, but ssshhhhh...)\r\n\r\nIn short, if you hate Notepad (or have cause to use it frequently), you should be using this instead.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nSimple: go to the [install folder](https://github.com/ArtOfCode-/SimpleEdit/tree/master/install) and download the .zip file. Extract its contents, and run SimpleEdit.exe. Job done.\r\n\r\nSimpleEdit doesn't rely on system-wide configuration, so can be run from any file location - even on USB.\r\n\r\n## License\r\nSimpleEdit is licensed under the [GNU GPL v3](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).\r\n\r\n    SimpleEdit - Windows Notepad replacement text editor\r\n    Copyright (C) 2015 Owen Jenkins\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
